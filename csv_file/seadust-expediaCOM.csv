Lindsey,Traveled with family and small children,"Sep 6, 2022","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, amenities, property conditions & facilities",Staff are very friendly especially the busboy Oscar who interacted with our kids everyday and helped so much with check in and check out. The pharmacy on site was so helpful for last minute needs when travelling with kids. Pool was great and had a small lip that was perfect for young kids. The water park aspect wasn’t so great for really young kids(1 3). The kids club was a huge hit with our 3 year old and the staff were so kind. Our daughter especially loved that the potty’s in the kids club were mini sized just for her. The restaurants were all amazing. The Al la cartes and the buffet. We ate so well all week. We also saw a sea turtle digging to lay her babies on our last night! I highly recommend this resort. ,Stayed 7 nights in Aug 2022,07/09/2022
Tricia,Traveled with family,"Sep 5, 2022",Liked: Staff & service,The food was disappointing. The bathroom well shower part was horrible. It looks like it is becoming run down little by little.  Should of gone to an other hotel. I couldn’t even believe I had to pay for the spa I thought since I payed such a big price for ALL-INCLUSIVE that should be part of it too. ,Stayed 5 nights in Aug 2022,07/09/2022
